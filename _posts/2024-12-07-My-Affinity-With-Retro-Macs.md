I've always had a kind of sweet spot for Apple. They make good computers and other tech. But one thing I think that Apple did best was in their early years. I'm talking 1977 to 2002. Those, in my eyes, at least, were the golden days of Apple. From the beige boxes and dark gray PDAs of the 80s and 90s, to the metal/plastic/glass MP3 players, sassy advertisments and popping colors of the early 2000s, I love it all. And here's the thing. I've never used a single classic Mac. I've used my dad's 2012-ish Mac, but never the clunky boxes and CRTs. But that's probably going to change soon, because I'm going to buy a Flower Power iMac G3 soon! Exciting, right? That's all I'm going to say right now, but stay tuned for updates on my blog!
